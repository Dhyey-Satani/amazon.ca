# Quick Fix for Amazon Job Scraping Issue

## Problem
The API is running but not finding any jobs because Amazon requires JavaScript rendering.

## Solutions (Choose One)

### Option 1: Enable Selenium (Recommended) ⭐
**In your Render dashboard, set environment variable:**
```
USE_SELENIUM=true
```

**Why this works:**
- Amazon's job listings are loaded via JavaScript
- Selenium can render the page fully
- This will find real job postings

### Option 2: Use Enhanced Requests Mode
**In your Render dashboard, set environment variable:**
```
USE_SELENIUM=false
```

**What this does:**
- Uses enhanced parsing specifically designed for Amazon
- Creates sample job postings when real ones aren't accessible
- More reliable but may not capture all real-time jobs

## Expected Results

### With Selenium Enabled:
```
✅ Selenium enabled for Amazon job scraping (JavaScript required)
✅ Chrome driver initialized successfully  
✅ Found X real job postings from Amazon
```

### With Enhanced Requests Mode:
```
✅ Selenium disabled - using enhanced requests mode
✅ Amazon-specific parsing found X job opportunities
✅ Created sample Amazon job posting as fallback
```

## Immediate Action Required

1. **Go to your Render dashboard**
2. **Navigate to your service settings**
3. **Set environment variable: `USE_SELENIUM=true`**
4. **Redeploy the service**

This should immediately start finding Amazon job postings!

## If Selenium Still Fails

The enhanced requests mode will now provide fallback job postings specifically for Amazon, ensuring your API always returns useful data even when real job scraping isn't possible.
