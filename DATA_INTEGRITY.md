## 🚫 **What We've Removed**

### **Fake Data Sources Eliminated:**

- ✅ Any synthetic job data creation

### **Real Data Only:**
- ✅ Only actual Amazon job postings from verified URLs
- ✅ Genuine job titles and descriptions
- ✅ Authentic application links
- ✅ Verified job locations and dates

## 🔧 **API Endpoints for Data Management**

### **Clear Fake Jobs:**

```

## 📊 **Expected Behavior**

### **When Real Jobs Found:**
```

✅ New REAL job found: [Job Title] - [Location] - [URL]
```

### **When No Jobs Found:**
```

```
