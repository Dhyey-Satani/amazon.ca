# Railway 502 API Crash Fix - Enhanced Debugging

## 🚨 **Issue Identified**

Your logs show the **API service is crashing immediately** with exit status 1:
```
2025-09-15 20:31:15,477 WARN exited: api (exit status 1; not expected)
```

Nginx is working fine, but the Python API keeps crashing on startup.

## 🔧 **Root Cause Analysis**

The most likely causes for immediate API crashes:

1. **❌ Missing Python dependencies** - ImportError during startup
2. **❌ File permission issues** - botuser can't execute API files  
3. **❌ Environment variable problems** - Missing or incorrect configuration
4. **❌ Python path issues** - Module import failures
5. **❌ Port binding conflicts** - Another process using port 8081

## ✅ **Enhanced Debugging Fixes Applied**

### **1. Better Log Capture ([supervisord.conf](c:\Users\HP\Downloads\amazon.ca\supervisord.conf))**
- API logs now go to stdout/stderr (visible in Railway logs)
- No more hidden log files - you'll see exact error messages

### **2. Comprehensive Startup Testing ([entrypoint.sh](c:\Users\HP\Downloads\amazon.ca\entrypoint.sh))**
- Tests API import as root user first
- Tests API execution as botuser (same as supervisor)
- Shows detailed permission and environment info on failure

### **3. Detailed API Testing ([test_api_startup.py](c:\Users\HP\Downloads\amazon.ca\test_api_startup.py))**
- Tests all critical imports (fastapi, uvicorn, selenium, etc.)
- Tests FastAPI app creation
- Tests job monitor initialization
- Shows exactly which component is failing

### **4. Fixed User Permissions ([Dockerfile](c:\Users\HP\Downloads\amazon.ca\Dockerfile))**
- Set botuser home directory to /app
- Added execute permissions on Python files
- Fixed environment variables for botuser

### **5. Enhanced Environment ([supervisord.conf](c:\Users\HP\Downloads\amazon.ca\supervisord.conf))**
- Added PYTHONPATH=/app for proper module imports
- Added HOME=/app for botuser
- Added proper PATH environment

## 🚀 **Deploy and Debug**

```bash
git add .
git commit -m "Fix API crash - enhanced debugging and permissions"
git push origin main
```

## 📊 **What You'll See in Railway Logs**

### ✅ **If startup succeeds:**
```
=== API Startup Test ===
✅ requests imported successfully
✅ fastapi imported successfully  
✅ uvicorn imported successfully
✅ API startup test passed
✅ API test passed when running as botuser
Starting services...  
=== API Startup Debug ===
Starting API server on 0.0.0.0:8081
```

### ❌ **If it fails, you'll see exactly what's broken:**
```
❌ Error during testing: ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'fastapi'
```
or
```  
❌ API test failed when running as botuser!
Permission denied
```
or
```
❌ Error during testing: [Errno 98] Address already in use
```

## 🔍 **Common Fixes Based on Error Messages**

| Error Message | Solution |
|---------------|----------|
| `ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'X'` | Missing dependency in requirements.txt |
| `Permission denied` | File permissions issue - need to fix Dockerfile |
| `Address already in use` | Port conflict - need to change internal port |
| `Import failed` | Python path or module issue |
| `Chrome/ChromeDriver error` | Selenium setup issue (should be non-fatal) |

## 🎯 **Next Steps**

1. **Deploy these debugging fixes**
2. **Check Railway logs** for the detailed error messages
3. **Identify the specific failure** from the test output
4. **Apply targeted fix** based on the exact error shown

The enhanced debugging will show you **exactly** what's causing the API to crash, making it trivial to fix the specific issue.

**This approach eliminates guesswork - you'll know precisely what's broken! 🎯**
